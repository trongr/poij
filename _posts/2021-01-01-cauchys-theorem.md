# Goursat's Triangle Theorem

**Theorem.** *Let $ f $ be a holomorphic function in an open set $ \O \subset
\bC, $ and let $ T $ be a triangle with interior in $ \O. $ Then*

$$
\int_T f = 0.
$$

# Goursat's Rectangle Theorem

**Corollary.** *Let $ f $ be a holomorphic function in an open set $ \O \subset
\bC, $ and let $ R $ be a rectangle with interior in $ \O. $ Then*

$$
\int_R f = 0.
$$

These two results allow us to apply vector addition on paths to integrate $ f $ along, e.g.:

**Theorem.** *A holomorphic function in an open disk $ D $ has a primitive in $ D $.*

This theorem says that every holomorphic function has a local primitive (i.e. within any open disk).

# Cauchy's Theorem for a Disc

**Theorem.** *If $ f $ is holomorphic in an open disc $ D $, then*

$$
\int_{\g} f = 0
$$

*for any closed curve $ \g $ in $ D. $*

**Corollary.** *Suppose $ f $ is holomorphic in an open set containing the circle $ C $ and its interior. Then*

$$
\int_C f = 0.
$$

# Cauchy's Theorem for Toy Contours

**Theorem.** *If $ f $ is holomorphic in an open set containing a toy contour $ \g $ and its interior $ \g_{\int} $, then*

$$
\int_{\g} f(z) dz = 0.
$$
